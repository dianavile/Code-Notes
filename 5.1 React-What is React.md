   ## What makes React Special?
  The fundamentals of React are:
  1) its componential nature.
  2) the way data flows to a component.
  3) React is just JavaScript.   
  
   ## What is Composition?
  `Composition`= to combine simple functions to build more complicated ones.
  
  ### Benefits of Composition
 __How we can build up complex functions by combining simple ones together?__

  `composition`= __built from simple functions!__

  Example:
  getProfileLink() function with composition:
  ```
function getProfileLink (username) {
  return 'https://github.com/' + username
}
```
getProfilePic function:
```
function getProfilePic (username) {
  return 'https://github.com/' + username + '.png?size=200'
}
```
### COMPOSITION 
- To compose these simple functions, just combine them together into another function:
```
function getProfileData (username) {
  return {
    pic: getProfilePic(username),
    link: getProfileLink(username)
  }
}
```
Example:
`getProfileData()function` without composition:
(provide the data directly)
```
function getProfileData (username) {
  return {
    pic: 'https://github.com/' + username + '.png?size=200',
    link: 'https://github.com/' + username
  }
}
```
__NOTE__: This is accurate JavaScript code. But this isn't composition. 

Potential issues with this version that isn't using composition. If the user's link to GitHub is needed somewhere else, 
then duplicate code would be needed. 
A good function should follow the "DOT" rule=   `Do One Thing`

This function is doing a couple of different (however minor) things; 
- it's creating two different URLs, 
- storing them as properties on an object, 
- and then returning that object. 

YET, In the __composed version__, each function just does one thing:
- `getProfileLink` = builds a string of user's GitHub profile link
- `getProfilePic` = builds a string the user's GitHub profile picture
- `getProfileData`= returns a new object

### React & Composition
React makes use of the power of composition, heavily! React builds up pieces of a UI using components. Let's take a look at some pseudo code for an example. Here are three different components:
```
<Page/>
<Article/>
<Sidebar/>
```
Now let's take these simple components, combine them together, and create a more complex component (aka, __composition in action!__):
```
<Page>
  <Article/>
  <Sidebar/>
</Page>
```
Now the Page component has the Article and Sidebar components inside. 
This is just like the earlier example where `getProfileData` had `getProfileLink` and `getProfilePic` inside it.
__NOTE__: Composition plays a huge part in building React components.

### Composition Recap
Composition occurs when simple functions are combined together to create more complex functions. Think of each function as a single building block that does one thing (DOT). When you combine these simple functions together to form a more complex function, this is composition.

### What is Declarative Code? 
#### Imperative Code
A lot of JavaScript is _imperative code_:

`expressing a command; commanding`

When JavaScript code is written imperatively, we tell JavaScript exactly what to do and how to do it. 
Think of it as if we're giving JavaScript commands on exactly what steps it should take. For example, I give you the humble for loop:
```
const people = ['Amanda', 'Geoff', 'Michael', 'Richard', 'Ryan', 'Tyler']
const excitedPeople = []

for (let i = 0; i < people.length; i++) {
  excitedPeople[i] = people[i] + '!'
}
```
If you've worked with JavaScript any length of time, then this should be pretty straightforward. We're looping through each item in the people array, adding an exclamation mark to their name, and storing the new string in the excitedPeople array. 

This is __imperative code__: We __command__ JavaScript what to do at every single step: 

- 1) set an initial value for the iterator - (let i = 0)
- 2) tell the for loop when it needs to stop - (i < people.length)
- 3) get the person at the current position and add an exclamation mark - (people[i] + '!')
- 4) store the data in the ith position in the other array - (excitedPeople[i])
- 5) increment the i variable by one - (i++)

#### Declarative Code
In contrast to imperative code, we've got declarative code. With declarative code, we don't code up all of the steps to get us to the end result. Instead, we declare what we want done, and JavaScript will take care of doing it. This explanation is a bit abstract, so let's look at an example. Let's take the imperative for loop code we were just looking at and refactor it to be more declarative.

With the imperative code we were performing all of the steps to get to the end result. What is the end result that we actually want, though? Well, our starting point was just an array of names:
```
const people = ['Amanda', 'Geoff', 'Michael', 'Richard', 'Ryan', 'Tyler']
```
The end goal that we want is an array of the same names but where each name ends with an exclamation mark:
```
["Amanda!", "Geoff!", "Michael!", "Richard!", "Ryan!", "Tyler!"]
```
To get us from the starting point to the end, we'll just use `JavaScript's .map()` function to declare what we want done.
```
const excitedPeople = people.map(name => name + '!')
```
__NOTE:__ with this code we haven't:
- 1) created an iterator object
- 2) told the code when it should stop running
- 3) used the iterator to access a specific item in the people array
- 4) stored each new string in the excitedPeople array
INSTEAD: all of those steps are taken care of by JavaScript's .map() Array method.

### 💡 .map() and .filter() 💡
#### React Is Declarative
We'll get to writing React code very soon, but let's take another glimpse at it to show how it's declarative.
```
<button onClick={activateTeleporter}>Activate Teleporter</button>
```
It might seem odd, but this is valid React code and should be pretty easy to understand. Notice that there's just an onClick attribute on the button... we aren't using .addEventListener() to set up event handling with all of the steps involved to set it up. Instead, we're just declaring that we want the activateTeleporter function to run when the button is clicked.

#### Declarative Code Recap
- __Imperative code__= instructs JavaScript on how it should perform each step. 
- With __declarative code__ = we tell JavaScript what we want to be done, and let JavaScript take care of performing the steps.

### Why REACT is declarative?
React is declarative because we write the code that we want, and React is in charge of taking our declared code and performing all of the JavaScript/DOM steps to get us to our desired result.

### QUIZ QUESTION
Is the following code imperative or declarative?
```
const people = ['Amanda', 'Geoff', 'Michael', 'Richard', 'Ryan', 'Tyler']
const longNames = people.filter(name => name.length > 6)
```
- __ANSWER:__ This is declarative. We didn't provide all of the steps that JavaScript should take to cycle through the list. Instead, we just told it to filter the list.

### Data-Binding In Other Frameworks
Front-end frameworks like Angular and Ember make use of __two-way data bindings__. In two-way data binding, the data is kept in sync throughout the app no matter where it is updated. If a model changes the data, then the data updates in the view. Alternatively, if the user changes the data in the view, then the data is updated in the model. Two-way data binding sounds really powerful, but it can make the application harder to reason about and know where the data is actually being updated.

### React's Data-flow
Data moves differently with React's __unidirectional data flow__. In React, the _data flows from the parent to a child component_.
Data flows down from parent component to child component. Data updates are sent to the _parent component_ where the parent performs the actual change.

![reacts-data-flow](https://github.com/dianavile/Code-Notes/blob/master/img/reacts-data-flow.png)

In the image above, we have two components:
1) a parent component
2) a child component

The data lives in the parent component and is passed down to the child component. 
Even though the data lives in the parent component, both the parent and the child components can use the data. 
However, if the data must be updated, then only the parent component should perform the update. 
If the child component needs to make a change to the data, 
then it would send the updated data to the parent component where the change will actually be made. 
Once the change is made in the parent component, the child component will be passed the data (that has just been updated!).

Now, this might seem like extra work, but having the data flow in one direction and having one place where the data is modified makes it much easier to understand how the application works.

### QUIZ QUESTION
QUESTION 1 OF 2: A FlightPlanner component stores the information for booking a flight. It also contains DatePicker and DestinationPicker as child components. Here's what the code might look like:
```
<FlightPlanner>
  <DatePicker />
  <DestinationPicker />
</FlightPlanner>
```
If this were a React application, which component(s) should be in charge of making updates to the data? Check all that apply.
- __ANSWER:__ Since `FlightPlanner` is the __parent component__ and stores the data, any changes to the data should be made by this component.

QUESTION 2 OF 2: Now let's say that the FlightPlanner component has two child components: LocationPicker and DatePicker.                 LocationPicker itself is a parent component that has two child components: OriginPicker and DestinationPicker.
If the following sample code were a React application, which of the following components should be in charge of making updates to data? Check all that apply.
```
<FlightPlanner>

  <LocationPicker>
    <OriginPicker />
    <DestinationPicker />
  </LocationPicker>

  <DatePicker />

</FlightPlanner>
```
- __ANSWER:__ The component that stores the data should be the one that updates the data.

### Data-flow In React Recap
In React, data flows in only one direction, from parent to child. If data is shared between sibling child components, then the data should be stored in the parent component and passed to both of the child components that need it.

### REACT is Just JavaScript
One of the great things about React is that a lot of what you'll be using is regular JavaScript. Over the past couple of years, functional programming has had a large impact on the JavaScript ecosystem and community. Functional programming is an advanced topic in JavaScript and fills hundreds of books. It's too complex to delve into the benefits of functional programming (we've got to get to React content, right?!?). But React builds on a lot of the techniques of functional programming... techniques that you'll learn as you go through this program. 
However, there are a couple of important JavaScript functions that are vital to functional programming that we should look at.
