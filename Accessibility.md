### a. __DEFINITION__: What is accessibility?
- `Good accessibility`("a11y"):`_to ensure all users can access the content in web and apps_`.
- Site _**content**_ needs to be `available` to everyone.
- Site _**functionality**_ needs to be `operable` to everyone.
__`Acessibility`__= to make sure "content" and "websites" created are `usable` to people with _various imparements or abilities._
- __Note:__ 
- `"a11y"` is a shorten word for `"accessibility"`(=there's 11 letters between the "A" and "Y" in the word "Accessibility"). 
- `"i18n"`is a shorten word for `"internationalization"`.
- `" l10n"`is a shorten word for `"localization"`.

### b. __USER EXPERIENCE:__ _Explore diversity of user experience with web and apps_
- Consider accessibility (`"a11y"`) from the start of your process, as it `affects all users`:

1) __Users with `_disabilities_`:__ (issues due to `human disability`.) 
- a. `Vision impairment`
  - __vision disability:__ (_blind or have significant difficulty seeing even with glasses_)
  - __refractive error:__ (_a visual impairment which may be corrected with glasses if mild enough_)
  - __color vision deficiency:__(_difficulty to distinguish colors_)
- b. `Hearing impairment`  
  - __hearing disability:__(_deaf or have significant difficulty hearing even with hearing devices_)
- c. `Cognitive impairment`
  - __cognitive disability:__ (_difficulty remembering, concentrating, or making decisions_)
- d. `Motor impairment`
  - __physical disability:__ (_part of the body does not work optimal_)
- __Note:__ These impairments can be `Temporary`, `Permanent`, or `Situational`.)  

2) __Users `_without disabilities_`:__ (issues due to `bad design`) 
- __unresponsive design__ 
- __lack of__ `color contrast` 
- __lack of__ `keyboard navigation`
- __lack of__ `visual or sound alternative`
- __lack of__ `zoom-in option`
- __lack of__ `minimal design`(_to minimize distraction_)

### c. SCREEN READERS/VIEWERS 
A __Screen viewer__ = `software that allows blind people to hear the information displayed on a screen, via text-to-speach-syntiziser.`

- The controls for ChromeVox Lite will appear once it is enabled:
- `"Voice"` drop-down: to choose alternate voices
- `"Speech rate"` drop-down: to make speech faster or slower
- `"Navigate"`buttons: to move ChromeVox's focus to non-focusable items on the page (e.g. Headers)
- `"Volume control"`: to fine-tune ChromeVox's volume.

### d. Web Content Accessibility Guidelines: 
_Web Content Accessibility Guidelines_ make your website and app 
- __"POUR"__ (4 core principles):
- `Percievable`: to make sure ALL users can "percieve" content. (_Is the content "visual, audio, text, keyboard, touch!- ready?_)
- `Operable`: to make sure users can "work" with the content. (_Can users use your components and navigate the content?_) 
- `Understandable`: to make sure users "understand" the content & the interface. (_Can users understand your content?_) 
- `Robust`: to make sure ALL users (_Is the content "robust" enought be be consumed by a wide variety of ages?_)
- __Note:__ Although the below guidelines are a great resource, what actually matters is `"the users experience"`.
