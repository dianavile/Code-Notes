# Promises

__Callback__ = `the default JS technique for Asynchronous work.`
It works like this: 
- Pass a function into another function 
- Call the call back function at some time later, when some conditions have been met.

It works fine, but is not a solution for everything:
Remaining questions are:
1) How to handle errors?

# Promises 
__Course Stages:__
1. Wrapping.
2. Thening.
3. Catching.
4. Chaining.

__States:__
1. Fulfilled (Resolved). => The action related to the promise succeeded.
2. Rejected. => The action related to the promise failed.
3. Pending. => Promise has not yet fulfilled or rejected.
4. Settled. => Promise has either fulfilled or rejected.
